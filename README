Undefined behavior C
====================

C to graph lang

    env TV_ROOT=... L4V_ARCH=RISCV64 bash make-graph-from-c.sh <in.c> <out.txt>

visualize a graph (need to have dot installed)

    python2 dot_graph.py <graph.txt> <function name>

Plan:

    - transforms blocks that go to Err into asserts (so that the CFG looks
      simpler) (??)
    - compute dominators
    (limitation: transform irreducible graph into reducible one)
    - ensure CFG is reducible
        - ignoring back edges, ensure graph forms DAG (sort topologically)
            - a back edge is an edge head ---> target who's target dominates the
              head
    - ssa
    - remove back edges and havoc loop written variables
    - determine biconditions
    - prove bicondition & assert is always unsat

    determining loop invariants/when they are strong enough need more thoughts

All code must be formatted with black.

If you're using pyright, you'll most likely want in the file
`/pyrightconfig.json`

    {
        "extraPaths": ["../graph-refine"]
    }
